# MaterialUI
This example (with modification) comes from the playlist 'React / Material-UI' by Code Realm on Youtube.com. While I was learning, I deceided to upload as I learn.

To try this example simply download the MaterialUI folder and then run `npm start` in the MaterialUI folder.
**Note you must have Node.js installed**
```
~/Documents/React/materialui $ npm start
```
